<h2> Diwali</h2>
<p style="background-color:honeydew;color:dark green">Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important festivals in India.
 It usually takes place in October or November. During Diwali, people celebrate the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.
 Homes are cleaned and decorated with colorful rangoli (art made on the ground) and oil lamps called diyas.
 People wear new clothes, exchange gifts, and share sweets with family and friends. Fireworks are a big part of the celebrations, lighting up the night sky.
 Many people also pray to the goddess Lakshmi for wealth and prosperity. Diwali is a time for joy, togetherness, and the triumph of hope and goodness.<br>   Nagamalli Venkat Sai<br>   August 26 batch </p>
